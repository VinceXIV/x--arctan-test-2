# Testing Arctan

This project was for testing the use of arctan. I wanted a function that can be used to calculate the orientation of single pixels in an image using a collection of four pixels. I wanted it to also be linear. That is, an incrase in 1 degree should change the value obtained from the function by a constant unit regardless of whether the change happens when the orientation is already 90 degrees or 50

The straight lines show that the function actually behaves as expected. That is, changes in angle has a linear effect on the angle obtained from the function
